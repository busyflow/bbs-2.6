/**
 * Makes the world agree with what the film says about its crowds.
 *
 * <p>Every tick of a playback the question asked of each crowd is "should this be standing here
 * right now?". If it should and is not, it is spawned; if it should not and is, it is removed.
 * Nothing has to fire at the right moment and nothing can be missed, which is the whole point of
 * moving crowds off clips - a spawn that did not happen used to leave an empty shot and no
 * error, and the only symptom was looking at the scene and seeing nobody.</p>
 *
 * <p>The cost of asking has to stay near zero, because it is asked twenty times a second against
 * crowds of five figures. So the answer is remembered rather than measured: this holds what it
 * spawned and the {@link Crowd#signature()} it spawned it from, and does nothing at all unless
 * one of those disagrees with the film. Counting live members to check would mean walking every
 * entity in the world each tick, which costs far more than the bug it would catch.</p>
