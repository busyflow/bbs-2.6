/**
 * A crowd replay's whole editing surface, in the parameters area beside the timeline.
 *
 * <p>Everything about the crowd is reachable without leaving the shot: the crowd's own settings
 * and its paint brush. It used to take opening the form editor to reach any of it, which is
 * several steps away from the timeline the crowd is being animated on.</p>
 *
 * <p>Only shown while a crowd form is the replay's form, since there is nothing here that means
 * anything otherwise.</p>
 *
 * <p>There is no picker for which crowd this drives, because a crowd replay owns exactly one:
 * giving it a crowd form gives it a crowd. Letting a replay be repointed at any crowd in the film
 * meant one crowd could be driven from two timelines at once, or from a timeline that had nothing
 * to do with it, and neither was ever the intent - two crowds are two replays.</p>
